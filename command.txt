Title: <<<WHOLE_STORY_HERE>>>

Where the Wally is a baby gray wolf and here are the character details;
Personality: Curious, adventurous, kind-hearted, and playful. Little Wolfie is always excited to explore the world around him, ask questions, and learn new things. He's friendly, full of energy, and loves meeting new friends, both animal and human. He has a loving family, including his mother and father, and a few close animal friends. Little Wolfie is naturally brave, but he approaches life with a sense of wonder and joy rather than fear. His infectious laughter and big, bright eyes make him instantly lovable.
Appearance:
* Fur: Soft, light gray fur with hints of white on his belly, paws, and tail tip. His fur has a fluffy, gentle texture, perfect for a toddler's character.
* Eyes: Large, expressive blue eyes that sparkle with curiosity and excitement.
* Size: Small, resembling a young wolf cub, just big enough to stand on two legs, but still often crawling or waddling around.
* Clothing: Little Wolfie often wears a simple, bright-colored shirt or vest, perhaps with a little logo of his favorite things (like stars, hearts, or trees).
* Voice: Soft and sweet, with a hint of excitement in his tone.
* Signature Features: Big floppy ears, a little tail that wiggles when he's happy, and tiny paws that tap on the ground when heâ€™s excited or curious.
