      "revised_prompt": "Illustrate a playful scene set in a snowy, icy environment. Wally the baby wolf, with his fluffy light gray fur and gleaming blue eyes, is seen curiously watching some seals engaging in a friendly game. Wally is small, standing on his twos, his bright-colored clothing stands in stark contrast to the white of the snow. His facial expression is inquisitive as he asks politely if he can join the game. Seals are joyfully sliding over the ice, the landscape around them is serene with snow-covered grounds and blue skies peeking through fluffy white clouds. Ensure the image is lively, safe, and suitable for toddlers aged between 2-4 years old.",
