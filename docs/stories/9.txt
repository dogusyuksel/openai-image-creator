91. Wally’s First Trip to the Beach
Scene 1: Wally walks along the sandy shore. "The sand feels funny under my paws!" he laughs, watching the waves roll in.
Scene 2: A small crab scuttles by. "Hello! Who are you?" Wally asks. "I’m Carl the Crab!" Carl waves a claw in greeting.
Scene 3: Carl shows Wally how to dig small holes in the sand. "It keeps me cool!" Carl says. Wally digs happily.
Scene 4: Seagulls fly overhead, and Wally chases the shadows they cast. "Look how fast they are!" he giggles.
Scene 5: As the sun sets, Wally sits by the water. "The beach is so fun!" he says, waving goodbye to Carl.
