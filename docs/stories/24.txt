70. Wally and the Hedgehog's Hideaway
Scene 1: Wally walks by a bush and hears rustling. "Who’s there?" he asks, peeking behind it.
Scene 2: Henry the Hedgehog curls into a ball. "I’m shy," Henry says softly. "It’s okay, I’m friendly!" Wally replies.
Scene 3: Henry slowly uncurls. "I like collecting leaves," he says, showing Wally his little pile.
Scene 4: "Can I help?" Wally asks. Together, they gather more leaves and stack them into Henry’s burrow.
Scene 5: "Thank you, Wally! This will keep me warm at night," Henry says. Wally smiles. "I’m glad I could help!"
