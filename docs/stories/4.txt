Scene 1: Wally sees black and white shapes moving through the grass. "Are those horses?" he asks.
Scene 2: Zara the Zebra trots up. "We’re zebras! Our stripes keep us safe."
Scene 3: Wally walks beside Zara. "Why do you all look the same?" he asks. "It confuses predators!" she explains.
Scene 4: The herd runs together, and Wally races to keep up. "You’re fast!" Wally says, panting.
Scene 5: "Come run with us anytime!" Zara smiles, as Wally rests in the shade.
