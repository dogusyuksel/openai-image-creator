92. Wally and the Dolphins’ Game
Scene 1: Wally stands on a pier, looking out at the water. "What’s that jumping?" he wonders, spotting splashes.
Scene 2: Denny the Dolphin pops up. "We’re playing leapfrog! Want to watch?" Denny asks.
Scene 3: Wally watches as dolphins leap high in the air. "Wow! You’re amazing jumpers!" he shouts.
Scene 4: Denny flips playfully. "You try, Wally!" Wally jumps as high as he can on the pier, pretending to be a dolphin.
Scene 5: "Come back anytime to watch us!" Denny says. "I will!" Wally laughs, feeling like part of the pod.
